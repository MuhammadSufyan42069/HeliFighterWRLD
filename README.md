Testing out WRLD plugin in this Helicopter Shooter Game for NETSOL Tech. 


Hello, It was super fun to Try out WRLD plugin. I Learned a lot in a very short time due to Ramzan timings and all couldn't give it my best shot tho! Hopefully would love to get into POI Api's on Weekend.

About the project,

I made the controller, imported Plugin(went smooth). Explored the demo scenes. Was able to hard code geo Locations(present in assets as a text file as well). 
SpawnManager controls the spawning of Enemies(Turrets with Homing Missiles). It has seperate functions for Building and Road Enemies.
Missile System(Not very Superb). A bit of code mess. But works.
About Road enemies, Super Hard Coded coz i had to go through a lot in very short time, so Apologies in advance. I wanted to Object Pooling as well but couldn't find the time. 

Gracious :)
